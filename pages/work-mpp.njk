                            MealPrepPro is a meal-planning app designed to simplify healthy eating by generating customised weekly meal plans. Its intelligent algorithm considers calorie targets, activity levels, allergies, and food preferences to create optimised plans, making meal prep effortless.

                            To enhance user engagement and reinforce the intelligence behind its meal-planning process, MealPrepPro sought to improve two key areas of the user journey:

                            The meal planner flow was refined, a compelling 2D animation was designed for the AI-powered system, and the review experience was restructured to improve clarity and reduce drop-off rates.

                        MealPrepProâ€™s core value proposition lies in its ability to generate tailored meal plans based on a wide range of user preferences. However, two key challenges were identified:

                        The goal was to design engaging UI elements and animations that visually reinforced the intelligence behind the meal planner while also streamlining the review experience to improve user retention.

                        <strong>Approach</strong>

                        <span class="font-[400]">Animated orb</span>
                        <br>
                        Different visual styles for the animation were explored, including AI-inspired glowing elements, spinning flows, and floating bubbles. Using Rive, an interactive animation was developed where a central orb pulsed and cycled through user inputsâ€”such as flavour preferences, activity levels, and portion sizesâ€”before generating a customised meal plan. Floating meal images appeared in animated bubbles, reinforcing the personalised selections.
                        <br><br>
                        <span class="font-[400]">Meal planner review</span>
                        <br>
                        The review screen was restructured to improve clarity by introducing a revised layout and clearer visual indicators, such as meal repetition dots, to help users understand how meals were scheduled. Expandable tool sections were added to enhance usability, including features like 'Use Up an Ingredient' to help users find meals based on leftover ingredients, 'Time Constraints' to allow filtering by preparation time, and 'Recipe Mix' to prioritise user favourites. To refine interaction patterns, swipable cards replaced static lists, making meal comparisons more intuitive, and a "Browse All Recipes" button was introduced to provide additional flexibility. Accessibility was also increased by incorporating features such as text contrast adjustments, alternative text for images, and voice-over compatibility to support a broader range of users.

                        <strong>The Solution</strong>

                        The final experience featured a dynamic AI-powered animation that made the meal planning process tangible and engaging. The review flow was streamlined with intuitive filtering tools and clearer meal repetition logic. Interaction design was improved with a swipable carousel for meal alternatives, clearer call-to-action buttons, and an optimised layout that reduced cognitive load. Greater inclusivity was also achieved by ensuring diverse dietary needs were better accommodated within the meal selection process.

                        <strong>Results &amp; Impact</strong>

                        Initial feedback indicates that the animated orb has helped users feel more connected to the intelligence behind their meal plan. The improved review experience has made meal customisation more intuitive, reducing confusion around meal repetition and refining workflows for finding alternatives. Engagement with the refinement tools suggests that users appreciate having more control over their plans, though further data collection is needed to quantify impact. The added accessibility features have improved usability for a wider range of users, making the app more inclusive.

                        <strong>Learnings &amp; Next Steps</strong>

                        This is an ongoing project, and the team will continue to optimise and iterate on various parts of the journey through A/B testing and gathering user feedback. This case study focuses on two specific areas of the journey, with more to follow in the future.
                        <br><br>
                        User feedback reinforced the importance of balancing animation length with engagement and ensuring the review process is both flexible and intuitive. Future iterations could explore additional interactivity within the orb animation to further personalise the meal plan generation process. More advanced filtering and customisation tools could be developed to provide greater flexibility in the review experience. AI-driven micro-interactions may offer real-time feedback and guidance within the meal planner, and further accessibility improvements, such as personalised meal suggestions based on cultural preferences or ingredient substitutions for dietary restrictions, could be introduced.
                        <br><br>
                        By continuing to refine these areas, MealPrepPro can further enhance its value proposition and improve overall user retention.
